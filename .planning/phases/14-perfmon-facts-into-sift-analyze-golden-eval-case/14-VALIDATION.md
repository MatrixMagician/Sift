# Phase 14 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | pytest 8.x |
| **Config file** | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Quick run command** | `uv run pytest tests/test_perfmon_facts.py tests/test_hypothesise.py -q` |
| **Full suite command** | `uv run pytest` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~60 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `uv run pytest tests/test_perfmon_facts.py tests/test_hypothesise.py -q`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `uv run pytest`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green (plus `ruff check` and `pyright` clean)
- **Max feedback latency:** 60 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| {N}-01-01 | 01 | 1 | PERF-07 / PERF-08 | — | {expected secure behavior or "N/A"} | unit | `{command}` | ✅ / ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] Overlapping perfmon golden fixture (CSV+log with in-span samples) + self-verifying overlap guard — the shipped Hartford deny pair does NOT overlap (RESEARCH.md BLOCKER); without an overlapping fixture the PERF-08 gate is vacuous
- [ ] `tests/_perfmon_fixtures.py` — reuse existing synthetic PDH-CSV builders for the golden fixture

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| — | — | — | — |

*All phase behaviors have automated verification (byte-identity golden hashes, anti-hallucination, no-digit guard, citable-subset, eval regression gate).*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 60s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
